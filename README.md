# PJ Studio

## Intro

This is the first Frontend project I have done.

## Contents

It contains a navbar and hero, followed by a subhero section that explains the process of this product. Then comes a custom mobile app section. The next step includes the three steps: Custom CMS, Payment Processing and Appstore Submission, represented in a vibrant and responsive manner. The Web Development feature and Signup cards come together afterwards. The design ends with the footer that contains useful links for better and easier user experience.

## Technologies

Nothing fancy! Just some good old HTML and CSS with a touch of vanilla JavaScript (plus some animate.style to spice things up!).
